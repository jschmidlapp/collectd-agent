collectd-agent
==============

collectd-agent is an application that allows SNMP managers to retrieve collectd
statistics.  It acts as either a master or sub-agent and exposes a configurable
set of statistics via SNMP.  Both scalar and table representations of statistics
are supported.

Installation
============
./configure
make
make install

If collectd is not installed in a 'normal' location, you can specify the
location (e.g. /opt/collectd) using the --with-libcollectdclient configure
parameter.

collectd-agent uses unix sockets to communicate with collectd and so the
unixsock collectd plugin must be enabled.

collectd requires Net-SNMP to be installed on the target computer.

Configuration 
============= 
The agent's behavior is defined in the configuration file (by default
/etc/collectd-agent.conf), which is intentionally similar to the collectd
configuration format.  Three high level sections are allowed: Settings, Value
and Table.  Only a single Settings section may be specified, but multiple Value
and Table sections may be used.  An example configuration file is provided with
the distribution (examples/example.conf).

  Settings
  --------
  CollectdAddress address
    This specifies the Unix socket that the collectd unixsock plugin uses.  You
    can find the exact value in the collectd configuration file, but its usually
    like /var/run/collectd-unixsock.
 
  MasterAgent true|false
    Specifies whether collectd-agent should run as a full SNMP agent
    (standalone) or as a sub-agent to an existing master agent on the host.

  AgentxAddress address
    If running as a sub-agent, this specifies the address that collectd-agent
    uses to communicate with the master agent.  By default for Net-SNMP this is
    /var/agentx/master, but may be overridden in the system's snmpd.conf with
    the agentXSocket option.

  Value
  -----
  Each Value entry specifies a single scalar value that will be exposed.  The
  Name is the full collectd statistic and the OID is the SNMP object ID that
  will be used to retrieve the statistic.  The OID may be a full numeric value
  or may use abbreviated, symbolic names such as SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.

  Note that to use symbolic names, the correct MIBs must be installed on the
  system.  This can be verified by ensuring that `snmptranslate` correctly
  translate the symbolic name to a numeric OID.

  The Type can be one of four values: Integer32, Counter32, Gauge32 and
  Counter64.  It is up to the the user to ensure that the type of collectd
  statistic, the SNMP MIB and the configuration all refer to the same underlying
  type.
 
  Table
  -----
  Each table entry starts with the root OID value.  This can be either number or
  symbolic (see above).  The remaining entries specify all of the columns of the
  table.  Each column entry specifies the column number (1,2,3...), the collectd
  stat name and the type.  The collectd stat name should include a single '*'
  that signifies the index for the table.  For instance, suppose you want to 
  expose statistics regarding the number of bytes transferred on a series of 
  network interfaces.  These stats look like hostname/interface-1/bytes, 
  hostname/interface-2/bytes, etc.  The stat name entry in the column would be
  hostname/interface-*/bytes.

Issues
======
My original purpose for developing collectd-agent was to retrieve integer value
statistics.  In the current version, there really isn't any support for
representing floating point values at all.  To do this, there would probably
need to be some kind of 'shift' parameter added to the configuration for each
Value so that the floating point value could be converted to an integer value
that SNMP could understand.

At this point, collectd-agent has only been tested under Debian.
